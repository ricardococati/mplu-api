#### Summary
This project aims to validate the DNA sequence of a mutant. For this the system receives the DNA sequence, and through a simple method of validation of the sequence, attests if the DNA is of a human or mutant. It also exposes an api that informs the percentage of mutants that were found in DNA sequence analyzes.

#### Business rules:
* Validation of the DNA sequence.
* Saves all searches performed on the database.
* Method of calculating the percentage of mutants found.


#### Technology

* [Java 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) * Tomcat embedded
* [HSQLDB](http://hsqldb.org/) * Used to store data from each DNA sequence check
* [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/)
